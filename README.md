# CalandarProject
The goal is to create a very simple calendar. The calendar allows the user to choose a month and then displays all appointments in this month. The user can also click on the appointment to see additional details about the appointment.

UI / Interaction Requirements:

o The user can access the calendar by clicking on a link in the menu
o In the calendar, the user can select a month by clicking on it
o The calendar displays all appointments inside this month
o The calendar displays the date and the description of the appointment
o The items in the calendar are links to a detail page
o The detail page should show the details of the appointment
o Organizer, Subject, Attendees, Date

Data Access Requirements
o You may whatever you like to store the data: an in-memory collection, an actual database, the
filesystem, mocks, etc
o No additional UI needs to be created for the write operations, however they data access code
should be functional
